Choose where you create a sismic wave. Much deeper te wave starts it hurts building less but effects wide area, much shalloTaller the building, harder to demolish it. Shallower the wave starts it hurts building more but in narrow area. Dont forget you have limitted energy! If demolish one or more building consecutively 15 times you will be rewarded with a combo bonus!</p>\n<p>Special thanks to organizers of GGJ2017 ATOM for awesomeness </p>',frontmatter:{title:"Game of Destruction (GGJ 2017)",date:"January 22, 2017",tags:"general"}}},pathContext:{path:"/game-of-destruction/"}}}});

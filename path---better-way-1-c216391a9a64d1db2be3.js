These words are my opinion and I am really happy if you send feedbacks, prove me wrong. I will try to keep series up to date. In this Episode I will be doing a small introduction to my disturbances about game AIs. For the next episode: --------</p>\n<p>I play games from little ages. When I was a kid I could not play much online games. Because Internet was not an easy resource to get it. Since there were no affordable internet provider most of the games that i played was offline singleplayer games. Some of them was still multiplayer games but I played them with bots. After some time of playing you starting to get bored or even dont look at games face again because you realize it is all the same and there is nothing to explore.</p>\n<p>For some games this is very very critical. For example imagine you are playing a strategy game and you win it. What happens if you used the same strategy again? You probably win again. Well this needs to end. Computers became powerfull and new methodologies improved to solve this.</p>\n<p>Humans have the luxury of learning from past mistakes. In game AIs especially when strategy making involved this problems needs to be solved. This methodolgy also needs to be observable and easy to modify some certain parts of it. For example you want to re-create a historic event. This is when we want our game designer to get involved and add the magic in it.</p>\n<p>This was the first version of first post of Must Be a Better Way. This post itself will also get updated according to new methodolgies I discovered, learning from mistakes and much importantly your feedbacks.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time :)</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Must Be A Better Way",date:"March 13, 2018",tags:"Artificial Intelligence"}}},pathContext:{path:"/better-way-1/"}}}});
